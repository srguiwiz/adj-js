# Adj Framework - Repository README

Adj commands modify SVG.

One significant feature is "relative constraints".

The original purpose of the Adj framework has been to facilitate
creation and long term maintenance of system diagrams.
Adj has been designed specifically for diagrams of large complexity.
Other uses are possible and are expected.
